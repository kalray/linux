SMP
===

On K1C, 5 clusters are organized as groups of 16 processors + 1
secure core (RM) for each cluster. These 17 processors are L1$ coherent
for TCM (tightly Coupled Memory). A mixed hw/sw L2$ is present to have
cache coherency on DDR as well as TCM.
The RM manager is not meant to run Linux so, 16 processors are available
for SMP.

Booting
=======

When booting the K1C processor, only the RM is woken up. This RM will
execute a portion of code located in a section named .rm_firmware.
By default, a simple power off code is embedded in this section.
To avoid embedding the firmware in kernel sources, the section is patched
using external tools to add the L2$ firmware (and replace the default firmware).
Before executing this firmware, the RM boots the PE0. PE0 will then enable L2
coherency and request will be stalled until RM boots the L2$ firmware.

Locking primitives
==================

spinlock/rwlock are using the kernel standard queued spinlock/rwlocks.
These primitives are based on cmpxch and xchg. More particularly, it uses xchg16
which is implemented as a read modify write with acswap on 32 bit word since
k1c does not have cmpxchg for size < 32bits.

IPI
===

An IPI controller allows to communicate between CPUs using a simple
memory mapped register. This register can simply be written using a mask to
trigger interrupts directly to the cores matching the mask.
