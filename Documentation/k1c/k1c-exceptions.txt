Exceptions
==========
On K1C, handlers are set using $ev register which specifies a base
address and a stride. Then, handlers are laid in the following order:

         _____________
        |             |
        |  Syscall    |
        |_____________|
        |             |
        |  Interrupts |
        |_____________|
        |             | ^
        |   Traps     | | Stride
BASE -> |_____________| v


Interrupts, and traps are serviced similarly, ie:
- Jump to handler
- Save all registers
- Prepare the call (do_IRQ or trap_handler)
- restore all registers
- return from exception

entry.S file is (as for other architectures) the entry point into kernel.
It contains all assembly routines related to Interrupts/traps/syscall.
