K1C Core Implementation
=======================

This documents will try to explain any architecture choice for the k1c
linux port.

Regarding the peripheral, we MUST use device tree to describe ALL
peripherals. The bindings should always start with "kalray,k1c" for all
core related peripherals (watchdog, timer, etc)

System
======

sr0 will hold the current task_struct. This register is reserved and
should not be touched by any other code.

Boot arguments
==============

When booting, the kernel will look for a special magic in $r0 (0x494C314B)
This magic tells the kernel if there is arguments passed by a bootloader.
Currently, the following values are passed through registers:
 - r1: pointer to command line setup by bootloader
 - r2: device tree

If this magic is not set, then, the command line will be the one
provided in the device tree (see bootargs). The default device tree is
not builtin but will be setup by the runner used (simulator or jtag).

A default stdout-path is desirable to allow early printk.

Timers
======

The free-runinng clock (clocksource) is based on the DSU. This clock is
not interruptible and never stops even if core go into idle.

Regarding the tick (clockevent), we use the timer 0 available on the core.
This timer allows to set a periodic tick which will be used as the main
tick for each core. Note that this clock is percpu.

get_cycles implementation is based on performance counter. One of them
is used to count cycles. Note that since this is used only when the core
is running, there is no need to worry about core sleeping (which will
stop the cycle counter)

Context switching
=================

context switching is done in entry.S. When spawning a fresh thread,
copy_thread is called. During this call, we setup callee saved register
r15 and r16 to special values containing the function to call.

The normal path for a kernel thread will be the following:

 1 - Enter copy_thread_tls and setup callee saved registers which will
     be restored in __switch_to.
 2 - set r15 and r16 (in thread_struct) to function and argument and
     ra to ret_from_kernel_thread.
     These callee saved will be restored in switch_to.
 3 - Call _switch_to at some point.
 4 - Save all callee saved register since switch_to is seen as a
     standard function call by the caller.
 5 - Change stack pointer to the new stack
 6 - At the end of switch to, set sr0 to the new task and use ret to
     jump to ret_from_kernel_thread (address restored from ra).
 7 - In ret_from_kernel_thread, execute the function with arguments by
     using r15, r16 and we are done


Building
========

In order to build the kernel, you will need a complete k1c toolchain.
First, setup the config using the following command line

$ make ARCH=k1c O=your_directory default_defconfig

Adjust any configuration option you may need and then, build the kernel:

$ make ARCH=k1c O=your_directory -j12

You will finally have a vmlinux image ready to be run.

$ k1-mppa -- vmlinux

Additionally, you may want to debug it. To do so, use k1-gdb:

$ k1-gdb vmlinux
