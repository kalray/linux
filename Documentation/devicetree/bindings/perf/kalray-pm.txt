* Kalray k1c Performance Monitors

K1C core has several Performance Monitors for counting cpu and cache events.
The K1C PM representation in the device tree should be done as under:

Required properties:

- compatible :
	"kalray,k1c-core-pm"

- interrupts : The interrupt number for k1c PM is 3.
- interrupt-parent : The k1c core interrupt controller.
- kalray,pm-num : Number of Performance Monitors the k1c core has.

Example:
core_pm {
	compatible = "kalray,k1c-core-pm";
	interrupts = <3>;
	interrupt-parent = <&core_intc>;
	kalray,pm-num = <4>;
}
