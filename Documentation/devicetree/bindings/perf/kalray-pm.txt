* Kalray kvx Performance Monitors

KVX core has several Performance Monitors for counting cpu and cache events.
The KVX PM representation in the device tree should be done as under:

Required properties:

- compatible :
	"kalray,kvx-core-pm"

- interrupts : The interrupt number for kvx PM is 3.
- interrupt-parent : The kvx core interrupt controller.
- kalray,pm-num : Number of Performance Monitors the kvx core has.

Example:
core_pm {
	compatible = "kalray,kvx-core-pm";
	interrupts = <3>;
	interrupt-parent = <&core_intc>;
	kalray,pm-num = <4>;
}
