  Each cluster in the Coolidge SoC includes an Advanced Programmable Interrupt
  Controller (APIC) which is split in two part:
    - a Generic Interrupt Controller (referred as APIC-GIC)
    - a Mailbox Controller           (referred as APIC-Mailbox)
  The APIC-Mailbox contains 128 mailboxes of 8 bytes (size of a word),
  this hardware block is basically a 1 KB of smart memory space.
  Each mailbox can be independently configured with a trigger condition
  and an input mode function.

  Input mode are:
   - write
   - bitwise OR
   - add

  Interrupts are generated on a write when the mailbox content value
  match the configured trigger condition.
  Available conditions are:
   - doorbell: always raise interruption on write
   - match: when the mailbox's value equal the configured trigger value
   - barrier: same as match but the mailbox's value is cleared on trigger
   - threshold: when the mailbox's value is greater than, or equal to, the
     configured trigger value

  Since this hardware block generates IRQs based on writes to some memory
  locations, it is both an interrupt controller and an MSI controller.
