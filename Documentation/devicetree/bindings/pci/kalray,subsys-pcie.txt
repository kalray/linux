* Kalray initialization of PCIe subsystem settings

The presence of this node in the device tree is mandatory for PCIe-rc to work.
This module allow to enable or disable the Data Asynchronous Memory Error
(DAME). When disabled a failed non posted PCIe transaction will not generate a
DAME and thus will prevent the kernel to crash.
When DAME is disable, it is strongly recommended to activate AER, as then in
case of failed transaction a recovery procedure is started.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "kalray,subsys-pcie"
- reg = contains pcie subsystem address and length
- reg-names = must include "pcie_subsys"

Optional properties:
- kalray,disable-dame
	- if not present use default (at reset) settings
	- = <0> : DAME generation is enabled
	- = <1> : DAME generation is disabled

Example:
++++++++

pcie_subsys: pcie_subsys@5128350000 {
	compatible = "kalray,subsys-pcie";
	reg = <0x51 0x28350000 0x0 0x1000>; /* pcie subsystem */
	reg-names = "pcie_subsys";
	kalray,disable-dame = <1>;
};
