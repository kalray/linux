* Kalray initialization of PCIe subsystem settings

The presence of this node in the device tree is mandatory for PCIe-rc to work.
This module allow to enable or disable the Data Asynchronous Memory Error
(DAME). When disabled a failed non posted PCIe transaction will not generate a
DAME and thus will prevent the kernel to crash.
When DAME is disable, it is strongly recommended to activate AER, as then in
case of failed transaction a recovery procedure is started.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "kalray,subsys-pcie"
- reg = contains "pcie subsystem" and "bar decoder" address and length
- reg-names = must include "pcie_subsys"
- #address-cells: Address representation, must be set to <2>
- #size-cells: Size representation, must be set to <2>
- kalray,ftu-dev : must contain a reference to syscon ftu device
- kalray,kalray,phycore-dev : must contain a reference to syscon phycore device

Optional properties:
- kalray,disable-dame
	- if not present use default (at reset) settings
	- = <0> : DAME generation is enabled
	- = <1> : DAME generation is disabled
- kalray,force-phy-rst : If absent the value 0 is assumed.
	When 1, all PCIe PHY will be reseted, this might have an impact on already
	configured enpoints by the FSBL, this should only be used for test purpose.
- kalray,ovrd-nfurc : if absent 0 is assumed, otherwize change the n-furcation
  settings.

Example 1 :
+++++++++++
This is a minimal example which keep all default settings

pcie_subsys: pcie_subsys@5128350000 {
	compatible = "kalray,subsys-pcie";
	reg = <0x51 0x28350000 0x0 0x1000>; /* pcie subsystem */
	reg-names = "pcie_subsys", "bar_decoder";
	kalray,ftu-dev = <&ftu>;
	kalray,phycore-dev = <&pcie_rc_phycore>;
	#address-cells = <2>;
	#size-cells = <2>;
	ranges;
};

Example 2 :
+++++++++++
This is an advanced settings which overide default settings.

pcie_subsys: pcie_subsys@5128350000 {
			compatible = "kalray,subsys-pcie";
			reg = <0x51 0x28350000 0x0 0x1000>; /* pcie subsystem */
			reg-names = "pcie_subsys", "bar_decoder";
			kalray,ftu-dev = <&ftu>;
			kalray,phycore-dev = <&pcie_rc_phycore>;
			kalray,force-phy-rst = <1>; /* if 1 force reset of all PCIe PHYs */
			kalray,ovrd-nfurc = <1>; /* if present define n-furcation mode --> 2X8 */
			kalray,disable-dame = <0>; /* if 1 do not generate DAME when read access fail */
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <2>;
			ranges;
}
